# Register

- `s0-s7` are callee-saved general purpose registers
- `ra` is a register for the current return address
	-  In functions that call other functions `ra` will be saved to the stack and then loaded at the end of the function => ROP
- `jr ra` is the instruction used to return
- `gp` is a "global pointer"
	- used to do library call lookups, which typically get resolved into the register `t9` followed by a `jalr t9`
- `v0` and `v1` are used to return values from functions
- `a0` - `a3` are used for the first 4 function arguments
- `pc` : program counter
- `fp` : frame pointer

# Instructions

- `jalr` calls a function
	- Jumps And Links the return address to `ra` and it's using a Register
- ```lw s4,local_8(sp)``` : Load s4 from the stacks 

# To remember

_delay slot_: every branch and jump has an instruction following it which will get executed before the branch if it's taken, and also gets executed if the branch is not taken. 
	ROP gadgets that jump to a delay slot skipping the call it was supposed to go with can do useful things
