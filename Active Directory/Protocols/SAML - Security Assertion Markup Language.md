SAML 2.0 is an XML-based protocol that uses security tokens containing assertions to pass information about a principal (usually an end-user) between an identity provider and a web service (service provider). SAML 2.0 enables web-based authentication and authorization scenarios including single sign-on (SSO).

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between an identity provider and a service provider.

The SAML specification defines three roles: 
• The principal, generally a user 
• The identity provider (IdP) 
• The service provider (SP)
