GOST, which stands for "Gosudarstvennyy Standard" in Russian, is a block cipher algorithm used for encryption and decryption of data. It was developed by the Soviet Union and is also known as "GOST 28147-89." GOST is a symmetric key cipher, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

Key features of GOST include a 64-bit block size and a variable key length, typically 256 bits. It uses a series of substitution and permutation operations, making it resistant to various cryptographic attacks. GOST has been widely used in Russia and other countries that were part of the former Soviet bloc. However, it's less common in international cryptography standards compared to algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
