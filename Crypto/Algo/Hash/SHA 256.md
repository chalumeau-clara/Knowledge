SHA-256, which stands for "Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit," is a widely used cryptographic hash function. It takes an input (usually text or data) and produces a fixed-size 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. SHA-256 is known for its cryptographic strength and resistance to collision attacks, making it suitable for data integrity verification, password hashing, and digital signatures. It's commonly used in various security protocols and applications to ensure data remains unchanged and secure.
